# HKU-HKSLLEX - Hong Kong Sign Language Database

HKSLLEX is a collection of Hong Kong Sign Language data as part of the documentation effort of the Knowledge Exchange project "The Sound of Silence - A Journey through Deaf Culture in Hong Kong". This repository is designed to store and organize a comprehensive database of Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL) words, their English translations, and associated research data. It aims to provide a valuable resource for linguists, researchers, and educators studying HKSL, as well as individuals interested in learning the language.

## **How to access the data?**

GitHub version only: you can browse the signs online [using the online sign browser](sign_browser_github.html).

After downloading the database, open "sign_browser.html" for a user-friendly view of the database. The video/webp/ folder must be downloaded for the sign_browser to work.

Alternatively, you can download the entire database and access the data files. Videos are available in the video/ folder.

## **Documentation**

The database structure is defined in "data.schema.json" file. A human readable version is available in the docs folder.

## **Data Format**

The data is stored in JSON format. A flattened CSV file (in UTF8-BOM) is also provided for easy access.

The HKSL videos are provided in two formats. Available on OSF are the videos in reduced MP4 and WebP formats (due to storage limitations); they can be found in video/small and video/webP respectively. Full, high-definition videos are available on request.
