<h2 id="what-are-the-arto-categories">What are the ARTO categories</h2>
<p>Signs exhibit patterned iconicity, in which distinct patterns are
consistently used by gesturers and signers; the approach which result in
these patterns are “iconic strategies”, or “representational strategies”
(Hwang, 2017). Previous studies have classified iconic strategies in
various ways (Müller, 2013; Hwang, 2017).</p>
<p>As part of our HKSL project, we have developed the <strong>ARTO
categories</strong>. The ARTO categories are a classification system of
iconic strategies employed by morphemes. It describes how morphemes (and
its constituent hands) represent their referents.</p>
<p>There are a total of five ARTO categories. Three of the five
categories are adapted from Ortega et al. (2019), which in turn are
adapted from Müller (2013). They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Acting</em> (A)</strong>: Also known as
<em>handling</em> in Hwang et al. (2017). Represents <em>human
motion</em>, where a human is using or handling the object with their
hands. The hands depict <em>themselves</em>.
<ul>
<li>Example: KEY in HKSL.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>Representing</em> (R)</strong>: Also known as
<em>instrument</em> in Hwang et al. (2017). The hand <em>embodies an
object</em> as a whole, where the hands do not represent the motion of
the hands, but the body or the motion of the object. The hands depict
the <em>object</em>.
<ul>
<li>Example: DRAW in HKSL: the dominant hand represents the brush, and
the other hand represents the canvas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>Tracing</em> (T)</strong>: Also known as
<em>drawing</em>. The hands trace the outline of the referent.
<ul>
<li>Example: ROUND (圓), SQUARE (方) in HKSL.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart form these categories, we also added:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Orthography</em> (O)</strong>: The hand embodies or
traces a writing symbol (orthography).
<ul>
<li>Example: EAST (東) in HKSL.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>None</em> (N)</strong>: There is no iconicity strategy
employed, or none of the categories apply.
<ul>
<li>Example: AGE (年紀) in HKSL.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Two more categories exist in Müller (2013) and Hwang et al. (2017)
which are unused in our classification system:</p>
<ul>
<li><del><strong>Personification (P)</strong></del>: Hwang et
al. (2017). “The hands depict the size and shape of specific parts of
non-human animate entities whose bodies are represented by signers’ or
gesturers’ bodies”.
<ul>
<li>Examples: BEAR in JSL; CHICKEN in HKSL.</li>
<li>Signs that should fit into <em>Personification</em> should also
belong to <em>Representing (R)</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><del><strong>Molding (M)</strong></del>: Müller (2013). “The hands
mold or shape a transient scultupre, such as a picture frame or a bowl”.
<ul>
<li>Examples: BALL in HKSL.</li>
<li>Signs that should fit into <em>Molding</em> should also belong to
<em>Representing (R)</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="arto-is-submorphemic-and-complex">ARTO is submorphemic and
complex</h3>
<p>In Ortega et al. (2019), the iconic strategies are said to be
employed by the entire sign (the lexeme), and each sign can be said to
adopt one strategy only. Unlike Ortega et al. (2019), the ARTO category
is a submorphemic feature, and each sign may be assigned one or more
than one ARTO categories (including the N category).</p>
<p>Why are the ARTO categories submorphemic? In essence, this is because
they are further divisible on the morphemic level, but having semantic
meaning such that they must be above phonological levels. Take WHATSAPP
(verb) in HKSL for example. The sign has one morpheme, which consists of
two hands that are dependent on each other (one hand alone does not make
the morpheme). The dominant hand is the letter “W” spelt out, therefore
it belongs to the <em>Orthography (O)</em> category. The other hand
represents the phone, and belongs to the <em>Representing (R)</em>
category. Since the two different categories apply to different hands
within the same morpheme, the ARTO categories must be below morphemic
level.</p>
<p>As with many efforts of putting natural data into well-defined boxes,
there are nuances in iconic strategies that make assigning ARTO
categories quite difficult. One common issue is fusion of morphemes,
resulting in one hand being assigned multiple ARTO categories. The sign
UGLY in HKSL is an example of multiple ARTO categories in one morpheme.
The sign is one-handed, but the hand carries two categories: it is
<em>tracing (T)</em> because the hand outlines the face; it is also
<em>none (N)</em> because of the “bad” handshape used. For this
morpheme, we say that it belongs to both <em>tracing</em> and
<em>none</em>. While we are not entirely convinced that multiple
categories should be permitted, having them where needed comes with the
advantage of identifying fusional morphology where it exists.</p>
<h2 id="arto-string-notation">ARTO String Notation</h2>
<p>To make the data collection process more efficient, I have developed
the ARTO String Notation to efficiently capture the ARTO categories for
all morphemes in a sign. This was developed as a superset and
replacement of the earlier tentative “Fourslots Notation”. With this
Notation, the ARTO Categories of all morphemes in a sign can be
represented by an ARTO Code.</p>
<p>There are two types of symbols: the ARTO Symbols and the reserved
symbols.</p>

<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
<p>The overall structure of the ARTO Code in the String Notation can be
expressed in this Regular Expression:</p>
<pre class="regex"><code>/^(?:(?:[ARTON]+[arton]{0,})(?:, ?)?)+$/g</code></pre>
<h4 id="basics">Basics</h4>
<p>The ARTO Category of hand(s) in a morpheme can be represented by
their corresponding symbol.</p>
<p>RUN 跑 has one morpheme that acts out walking. Therefore the ARTO
Code is:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A</code></pre>
<h4 id="multimorphemic">Multimorphemic</h4>
<p>Morphemes are delimited by commas (<code>,</code>).</p>
<p>STARBUCKS 星巴克 has three morphemes. Morpheme 1 represents
‘awakening’; morpheme 2 acts out coffee; morpheme 3 traces the outline
of the hair of the Starbucks Siren. The ARTO Code would look like:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>R,A,T</code></pre>
<h4 id="other-hand">Other hand</h4>
<p>The ARTO Symbols are case-sensitive. <em>Uppercase</em> denote the
<em>dominant</em> hand, the <em>lowercase</em> denote the <em>other</em>
hand.</p>
<p>For example, BANANA 香蕉 has one morpheme. The dominant hand acts out
the peeling of the banana; the other hand represents the banana. The
ARTO Code for BANANA woud look like:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Ar</code></pre>
<p>If each hand has its own iconicity strategy (like BANANA), each
Symbol must be written out, even if both hands may have the same ARTO
Category. For example, the dominant hand of VOTE 投票 represents the
ballot, and the other hand represents the ballot box. The ARTO Code for
VOTE would be:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Rr</code></pre>
<p>Since the two hands have their own referents, it is incorrect to
write: <del><code>R</code></del>.</p>
<p>If the iconicity strategy is effective only with two hands together,
the ARTO Code is marked on the morpheme. The ARTO Code for MOVIE 電影,
where two hands form the shape of a film projector, would therefore
be:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>R</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <del><code>Rr</code></del> is incorrect because each
hand only represent one part of a “film projector”.</p>
<p>In very rare occasions, the morpheme consists only of the other hand.
In that case, write only the lowercase letter, for example:
<code>r,A</code> (first morpheme uses the other hand only).</p>
<h4 id="symmetrical-signs">Symmetrical signs</h4>
<p>Symmetrical signs (where one hand is the exact mirror image of the
other) are written like a one-handed sign. For example, START 開始,
where two hands form an opening motion, should be:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>R</code></pre>
<p>In the absence of handshape data, <code>2</code> is used to denote
symmetry. If handshape data is coded elsewhere, <code>2</code> should
not be coded.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>R2</code></pre>
<p>Note that signs must have hands <em>mirroring</em> each other to be
said as <em>symmetrical</em>. A counterexample is COMPETITION 比賽,
where individual hand movements where two hands alternately move up and
down, and is thus <em>not symmetrical</em>. Another counterexample is
LIVE 生活, where two hands move togetheer, i.e. the movement of the
other hand is not the <em>mirror</em> image of the dominant hand, and is
also <em>not symmetrical</em>.</p>
<p>Hands in a symmetrical sign can overlap, as long as they are
<em>mirroring</em>. An example MISUNDERSTANDING 誤會, where forearms
cross but the hands mirror each other, and thus is <em>symmetrical</em>.
However, FREEWAY 公路 (cars whizzling on a highway bridge) is <em>not
symmetrical</em> because despite the same handshape and movement and the
crossing, the hands are at a different elevation and are thus not mirror
images.</p>
<h4 id="morphemes-with-multiple-arto-categories">Morphemes with multiple
ARTO Categories</h4>
<p>Some signs use iconicity strategies that can arguably be “in between”
two or more categories; they would belong to more than one ARTO
category. In that case, write all applicable categories in the same
morpheme in the correct lettercase. There is theoretically no limit on
the number of categories for each morpheme.</p>
<p>For example, one variant of URINATE 小便 (extended from TOILET 廁所)
can classified as both <em>orthography</em> and <em>representing</em>
for its only morpheme. The ARTO Code for that is:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>OR</code></pre>
<p>Note that the order of the letters do not matter, so it is acceptable
to write the ARTO Code as <code>RO</code>. However, the standard way is
to list in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Multiple ARTO Categories for the other hand would look like this:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>Rrt</code></pre>
<h2 id="obsolete-notational-systems">Obsolete notational systems</h2>
<h3 id="fourslots-notation">Fourslots Notation</h3>
<p><em>Deprecated</em> – the Fourslots Notation encodes ARTO data with
exactly four columns. This is deprecated because the N category is not
coded and it is difficult to parse by machine.</p>
<p>For example, BADMINTON 羽毛球 in the ARTO String Notation is
<code>Tr,A</code>. In Fourslots, it is:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Acting</th>
<th>Representing</th>
<th>Tracing</th>
<th>Orthography</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>1_2</code></td>
<td><code>O_1_1</code></td>
<td><code>D_1_1</code></td>
<td><code>0</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
